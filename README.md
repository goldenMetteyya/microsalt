High Level Crypto library for your trusty rusty programs

# https://tweetnacl.cr.yp.to/
"TweetNaCl is the world's first auditable high-security cryptographic library. TweetNaCl fits into just 100 tweets while supporting all 25 of the C NaCl functions used by applications. TweetNaCl is a self-contained public-domain C library, so it can easily be integrated into applications."
